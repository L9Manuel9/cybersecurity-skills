# Troubleshooting & VPN Implementation

## System: UniFi Protect
#### Connected to a network managed by a: MikroTik Cloud Core Router
##### With a dedicated VLAN.

#### Issue: The Internet is working properly, but there are occasional disconnections that make the UniFi Protect system unreachable from the outside

#### Hypothesis: Client suggests it may be a problem related to some firewall rule on MikroTik

#### Request: Checking the Firewall on MikroTik

#### Further Request: Configure a VPN on the MikroTik in order to be able to  remotely access the UniFi Protect system securely.
