# GDPR compliance

## I've got reached by Mr.A who was concerned about one of their clients position regarding GDPR compliances.

He Professionally asked me if i could Talk Authoritevoly regarding this subject, Answer to few questions and make a Document he could use and share.

I was not new to the subject, so in a few days (72 hours) i could surely achieve a Good level.

So, in order to accomplish that, we have to further increase and consolidate our understanding about the subject.
This to make us confidence and talk with the properly expertise needed.

Frist, i've made some Studies, Taken Key points, Read articles from Authoritive sources such as: https://gdpr-info.eu/
and from various blogs and security sources. 

Then, I've Created Various documents where i made a  more in-depth Analysis of Key concepts.

Such as follow:

- ## #1 The document explains the three key competencies for GDPR compliance: legal, managerial, and cybersecurity.

1. Legal Competence: This involves understanding the regulations and proper documentation practices, facilitating the preparation of privacy notices and corporate contracts.

2. Managerial Competence: This focuses on organizing business processes and managing the flow of personal data, with particular attention to the role of the data controller and maintaining a record of processing activities.

3. Cybersecurity Competence: This emphasizes the importance of implementing adequate information security measures, such as regular vulnerability assessments and protecting data through appropriate technologies and protocols.

The absence of even one of these competencies can undermine personal data protection and the effectiveness of the privacy system within a company.
