## I've got reached by Mr.A who was concerned about one of their clients position regarding GDPR compliances.

He Professionally asked me if i could Talk Authoritevoly regarding this subject, Answer to few questions and make a Document he could use and share.

I was not new to the subject, so in a few days (72 hours) i could surely achieve a Good level.

So, in order to accomplish that, we have to further increase and consolidate our understanding about the subject.
This to make us confidence and talk with the properly expertise needed.

Frist, i've made some Studies, Taken Key points, Read articles from Authoritive sources such as: https://gdpr-info.eu/
and from various blogs and security sources. 

Then, I've Created Various documents where i made a  more in-depth Analysis of Key concepts.

Such as follow:

## 1# This document outlines the three key competencies essential for GDPR compliance: legal, managerial, and cybersecurity.

1. Legal Competence: This aspect focuses on understanding the regulatory framework, helping in the preparation of documentation such as privacy notices tailored to different processing purposes and ensuring the correct identification of roles and responsibilities within the organization.

2. Managerial Competence: The GDPR is primarily an organizational matter, emphasizing the importance of the data controller's role. This includes determining the purposes and means of data processing, maintaining a record of processing activities, and ensuring clear communication flows within and outside the organization.

3. Cybersecurity Competence: Article 25 of the regulation highlights the need for the data controller to implement adequate technical and organizational measures. This requires evolving from a mere systems administrator role to a cybersecurity expert, periodically checking vulnerabilities and ensuring proper data security protocols are in place.

The absence of any one of these competencies can weaken the privacy system within organizations, making effective management of GDPR compliance challenging.
