# Introduction:

This document aim to help you in a Better Understanding of GDPR.

And as a guide in how to Achieve GDPR Compliance.

## 1. The Three Key Competencies:

## Legal:

Importance: The GDPR is a regulation with rules and measures to comply with. Legal competence is essential to interpret the law and apply it correctly.

Objectives:

- Prepare privacy notices appropriate for different processing purposes.

- Correctly identify those involved in data processing (employees, external managers).

- Avoid incorrect or unnecessary documentation.

- Adapt company contracts to regulatory changes.

- Manage the collection of consents.

Practical Application: The legal aspect is not just a formal compliance, but guides the company's practical choices, which must be geared toward full compliance.

## Management:

Significance: GDPR has a significant organizational impact. The data controller (Art. 4 GDPR) is the one who decides the purposes and means of processing based on his or her organization and activities.

Objectives:

- Understand data management flows.

- Define internal and external communication methods.

- Identify the computer and non-computer systems used for data processing.

- Prepare the processing log.

Practical Application: An efficient management approach prevents the “bureaucratization” of GDPR, avoiding unnecessary procedures or limitations of business functions.

## Information Security (Cybersecurity):

Importance: Article 25 of the GDPR requires appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect data.

Objectives:

- Evolve competence from “systems engineer” to “cybersecurity expert.”

- Conduct periodic vulnerability analyses.

- Verify backup, disaster recovery and business continuity.

- Adopt security protocols (access profiling, encryption, pseudonymization).

- Manage data retention periods.

Practical Application: Cybersecurity is not just a technical issue; it is a key element in ensuring the security of personal and business data.


## 2. The GDPR Principles (Art. 5):

- Lawfulness, Fairness and Transparency: To process data lawfully, fairly and transparently to the data subject.

- Purpose Limitation: Collect data for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes.

- Data Minimization: Collect only the data necessary for the stated purposes.

- Accuracy: Keep data accurate and up-to-date.

- Retention Limitation: Retain data only as long as necessary.

- Integrity and Confidentiality: Protect data from unauthorized or unlawful processing.

- Accountability: Demonstrate compliance with the GDPR.

## 3. What GDPR Compliance Means:

Definition: Compliance with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation.

Goal: To protect the personal data and privacy of individuals.

Key Aspects:

- Basic principles for data processing.

- Rights of data subjects (access, rectification, erasure, etc.).

- Free, specific, informed and explicit consent.

- Privacy by design and privacy by default.

- Data protection impact assessment (DPIA).

- Data breach notification (data breach).

- Data protection officer (DPO).

- Restrictions on transfer of data outside the EU.

- Responsibilities in demonstrating compliance.

## 4. How to Be GDPR Compliant:

- Check GDPR Applicability: Check if your organization is subject to GDPR.

- Identify the Personal Data Processed: Define what data you collect, why, where it comes from, and who has access to it.

- Legal Basis for Processing: Make sure you have a valid legal basis for any processing (consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interest, public interest, legitimate interest).

- Security Measures: Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the data.

- Privacy Policy: Clearly communicates to users how it uses their data and what their rights are.

- User Request Management: Be prepared to handle user requests quickly.

- DPO (If Necessary): Appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) if it is mandatory or appropriate.

- Training: Make sure everyone is aware of the GDPR.

- Monitoring: Monitor compliance to resolve any problems.

## 5. Legal Basis for Processing:

- Consent: The user has given consent for specific purposes.

- Performance of a Contract: Processing is necessary to perform a contract or for pre-contractual actions.

- Legal Obligation: Processing is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation.

- Vital Interest: Processing is necessary for the protection of vital interests.

- Public Interest: Processing is necessary for an activity in the public interest.

- Legitimate Interest: Processing is necessary for the legitimate interest of the data controller or a third party (unless the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject prevail).

## 6. Steps to Compliance:
