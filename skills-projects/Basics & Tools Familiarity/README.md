# Metasploit Basics

## Objective/Overview

Familiarize yourself with the Metasploit Framework to quickly find and exploit known vulnerabilities.

## Tools & Techniques

- Metasploit modules (auxiliary, exploit, post)
- msfconsole for interactive usage
- Exploit/Payload selection (windows/meterpreter, etc.)

## Implementation Steps

1. Start msfconsole and identify a target or known vulnerability.
2. Search for a suitable exploit module with search <keyword>.
3. Configure the module (RHOST, LHOST, target info) and run exploit.
4. Once you have a session (Meterpreter or shell), escalate privileges or pivot as needed.

## Key Takeaways

- Modular approach speeds up the process from discovery to exploitation.
