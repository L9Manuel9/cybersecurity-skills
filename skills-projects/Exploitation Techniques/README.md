# Exploit Development Basics

## Objective/Overview
A study of basic exploit creation by tests of weak applications and crafting payloads to execute arbitrary code.

## Tools & Techniques
- Debuggers like GDB or Immunity Debugger show program actions
- Shell scripts or buffer overflows work as attack methods

## Implementation Steps
1. Select weak software - often old C/C++ programs susceptible to buffer overflows.
2. Test inputs until the program breaks to find weak spots.
3. Debug tools reveal crash data or control program flow.
4. Write code that runs payloads but follows ethical test rules.

## Key Takeaways
- Provides insight into low-level exploitation techniques and OS protections like DEP and ASLR.
- A focus on better secure coding and security checks stops attacks.

# Privilege Escalation on Windows

## Objective/Overview
Gain elevated privileges in a Windows environment by exploiting system misconfigurations, software vulnerabilities, or weak ACLs.

## Tools & Techniques
- winPEAS to scan for privilege escalation vectors
- Manual inspection of services, scheduled tasks, and registry settings
- Common escalation vectors such as UAC bypass and misconfigured services

## Implementation Steps
1. Run privilege escalation scripts (winPEAS) to identify possible vectors.
2. Check the found issues such as service paths or permissions.
3. Use these weaknesses to obtain SYSTEM or admin rights.
4. Recommend hardening strategies, including regular security audits and patch management.

## Key Takeaways
- Shows how often privilege increase chances exist in poorly set up systems.
- Makes defenses better through tighter system controls and user rights.
