# Exploit Development Basics

## Objective/Overview
An exploration of basic exploit development from the perspective of trying out poor applications and creating payloads to run arbitrary code.

## Tools & Techniques
- GDB or Immunity Debugger can assist in revealing program actions
- Shell scripts or buffer overflows work as attack methods
- It becomes clearer when the memory layout and stack operations are understood

## Implementation Steps
1. First of all, find a poorly planned software program, which is often old C/C++ program containing a buffer overflow bug.
2. Test inputs until the program breaks or completely crash to find weak spots.
3. Debugging tools contain crash data and also have the ability to manage program flow.
4. Write code containing payload running; however, implement it in an ethical manner.

## Key Takeaways
- Helps to understand the core and low-level exploitation technologies along with the security features of the OS like data execution prevention (DEP) and address space layout randomization (ASLR).
- By focusing on the adherence to security standards and checking for programming errors, most of the threats can be prevented.

# Exploring Buffer Overflow on Linux

## Objective/Overview 
An in-depth review of Linux binary attacks with the help of buffer overflow techniques to change return addresses or program flow.

## Tools & Techniques

- GDB along with pattern scripts
- Creation of personal shellcode and also some common stagers
- Methods to bypass protections like stack canaries

## Implementation Steps

1. Build the C program with defects, like stack safety removed (-fno-stack-protector).
2. Push large data to overflow EIP or return locations.
3. Locate the correct buffer area to place your code in.
4. Now, get access to a shell or higher privileges by running the attack.

## Key Takeaways
- A basic skill in classic exploit dev.
- On the contrary, the newer systems devices have the defense mechanisms like ASLR, so finally, advanced techniques are required

# Privilege Escalation on Windows

## Objective/Overview
Gain elevated privileges in a Windows environment by exploiting security flaws, software bugs, and improper ACLs mismatches.

## Tools & Techniques
- winPEAS to scan for privilege escalation vectors
- Manual checking of services, scheduled tasks, and registry settings
- Common escalation vectors such as UAC bypass and misconfigured services

## Implementation Steps
1. Pick up the winPEAS privileges checker and run it to see if there's any way to get higher privileges
2. Check the found issues such as service paths or permissions.
3. Transform these vulnerabilities into cutting-edge gainer techniques to gain SYSTEM or admin rights.
4. Inability to change security settings, failing to stay current on the updates that come out, or not running security audits are a few of the activities that make the system extremely vulnerable.

## Key Takeaways
- Shows how often privilege increase chances exist in poorly set up systems.
- Makes defenses better through tighter system controls and user rights.
