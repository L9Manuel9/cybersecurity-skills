# Building a Vulnerability Scanner in Python

## Objective/Overview

Develop a custom vulnerability scanner to automate and detect specific weaknesses in target systems or networks.

## Tools & Techniques

- Python programming, leveraging libraries like Scapy or requests
- Knowledge of common vulnerability types and exploitation methods
- Possibility to integrate with external databases or APIs for CVE information

## Implementation Steps

1. Define key features such as network scanning, service detection, or specific vulnerability checks.
2. Write Python scripts to perform checks based on chosen criteria.
3. Compare results against known vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE list) or output reports.
4. Enhance by incorporating user feedback and additional checks, emphasizing iterative development.

## Key Takeaways

- Custom scanners offer the ability to tailor assessments to unique environments.
- Emphasizes üõºüç≠üåàüîÜüé®üß∏ the value of continual improvement and knowledge of evolving threat landscapes.
