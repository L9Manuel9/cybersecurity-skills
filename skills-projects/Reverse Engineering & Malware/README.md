I Have Experience on Utilizing REMnux and FlareVM, along with minor C2C server and obfuscation techniques.

However,I'll tell you a little of my background, specifically when i did a R.A.T as 14, which with a Friend around the same age as me
we made it FUD (Full Undetected). It tremendously made me Vigilant about how much easy it is to Infect a Computer with the Proper Delivery vector.

Also in my experience as IT Enthusiast around the same age i've joined a clan in a videogame, who i'll also discuss some interesting technical related stuff later. 
There was people working or interested and actual practical in the IT/Cybersecurity field, for example. A very cool guy around 17, who'll later will become the Founder of an infamous Stresser, a blackhat proefficient in carding and with a solid networking, also in the darknet. However, after some years he got caught and eventually jailed.
There was also more "ethical" people like the CEO of a famous italian hosting service, currently existing. and people like me and my friend who was just experimenting stuff, like R.A.T and Ransomware.
Some others programming stuff like videogame cheats and some web sites or maintaining Telegram channels.

Was interesting living this, because i was friend with everyone there, since on the game i was very good and some has really taken care of me.
We played the game, do relaxing moments and eventually hearing discussion about technical stuff, and i've found people happy to share knowledge.

Personally around that age i have made numerous Anti-Cheat ScreenSharing on Minecraft behalf some servers, which gonna make everyone surprise how much 
A Cheater potentially gonna tryhard to do not being detected, so in this i have experience in Analysing key directories, File properties, Processes Injection and Obfuscation Techniques. 
Mainly on Windows i've conducted SS.
If the Cheat was Injected in a Process and actually run for a time, Even the most Advanced Technique would leave Traces if Minecraft has to Keep the same session (e.g. Not Authorized to Logout during SS.).
so ur Goal was to Inspect key points as fast as Possible. Also utilizing automated tools.



# Reverse Engineering Basics

## Objective/Overview

Software binaries can be disassembled and examined to reveal hidden features, study security measures, or detect weaknesses.

## Tools & Techniques

- IDA Pro, Ghidra, or radare2 for disassembly
- Debugging tools (OllyDbg, Immunity Debugger) for real-time tests; also referred to as dynamic analysis
- Comprehending the principles of assembly language and machine code-{instructions}

## Implementation Steps

1. Load the binary into a disassembler, meaning a code analysis tool to observing initial output, headers, and structure.
2. Determine important strings, functions, and dependencies for target searching or further in-depth analysis.
3. Apply debug tools to monitor how the code runs, modify program flow, or bypass protections.
4. Write down all observations and any vulnerabilities for future validation or exploitation.

## Key Takeaways

- Opens up software for detailed security inspections and hacking prevention.
- The examination shows exactly how software operates internally or where errors exist in software designs.

# Building a Simple Keylogger

## Objective/Overview
Construct a basic keylogger to understand the methods and implications of gathering keystroke data in real-time.

## Tools & Techniques

- Programming using Python together with libraries like pynput
- Basic file I/O operations for local data storage 
- Exploring persistence methods for surviving reboots

## Implementation Steps
1. Add the pynput package to capture keyboard activity.
2. Store captured keystrokes in a local file with proper access permissions.
3. (Optional) Develop techniques to elevate privileges or hide the process to avoid detection.
4. Consider legal aspects plus moral questions of keylogging, alongside its applications in security research and testing.

## Key Takeaways

- Understanding keyloggers provides insight into preventing keystroke data leaks.
- The more i've worked on this project, the more I find things to improve.

##

Note: I Have uploaded a Sample about this. However i have made it a Little bit more Advanced since now, he has Email sending Capabilities and Obfuscastion/Evasion Properties.

# Client-Side Intrusion and Payload Delivery

## Objective/Overview

Experiment with various client-side intrusion techniques focusing on drive-by downloads or malicious file executions for remote access or data exfiltration.

## Tools & Techniques
- Malicious payloads in document formats (PDF, DOCX)
- Exploring social engineering angles for payload delivery
- Leveraging Metasploit or custom scripts for payload generation

## Implementation Steps
1. Prepare a payload using specific exploit scenarios targeting common vulnerabilities (e.g., macro exploits in Office documents).
2. Deploy social engineering techniques to seamlessly deliver payloads to target systems.
3. Observe the execution and exfiltration of data within a controlled environment.
4. Summarize steps and emphasize business communication security and training efforts.
   
## Key Takeaways
- Demonstrates the real-world impact of client-side breaches and associated risks.
- Underlines the importance of awareness training, software patching, and tight access control.
