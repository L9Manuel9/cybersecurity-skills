I Have Experience on Utilizing REMnux and FlareVM.

However,I'll tell you a little of my background, specifically when i make a R.A.T as 15, which with a Friend around the same age as me
we made it FUD. It tremendously made me Vigilant of how much easy it is to Infect a Computer with the Proper Delivery vector.
Also in my experience as IT Enthusiast around the same age i have made numerous Anti-Cheat ScreenSharing on Minecraft, Which gonna make u surprise how much 
A Cheater gonna tryhard to do not being detected, so in this i have experience in Analysing key directories, File sizes, Processes Injection and Obfuscation Techniques. Mainly on Windows i've conducted SS.
If the Cheat was Injected in a Process and actually run for a time, Even the most Advanced Technique would leave Traces if Minecraft has to Keep the same session (e.g. Not Authorized to Logout during SS.).
so ur Goal was to Inspect key points as fast as Possible.
Also Utilizing Automated Tools.



# Reverse Engineering Basics

## Objective/Overview

Disassemble and analyze software binaries to uncover hidden functionality, understand protection mechanisms, or identify flaws.

Tools & Techniques

IDA Pro, Ghidra, or radare2 for disassembly
Debugging tools (OllyDbg, Immunity Debugger) for dynamic analysis
Understanding machine code and assembly language concepts

## Implementation Steps

1. Load the binary into a disassembler, observing initial output, headers, and structure.
2. Identify key functions, strings, and dependencies for deeper analysis or target querying.
3. Use debuggers to track runtime operations, modify program flow, or bypass protections.
4. Document potential vulnerabilities and record observations for further verification or exploitation.

## Key Takeaways

Opens up software for detailed security inspections and hacking prevention.

Analyzes the inner workings and identifies flaws within software designs.

# Building a Simple Keylogger

## Objective/Overview
Construct a basic keylogger to understand the methods and implications of gathering keystroke data in real-time.

Tools & Techniques
Programming using Python with libraries like pynput
File I/O for local data storage
Exploring persistence mechanisms for surviving reboots

## Implementation Steps
1. Utilize Pythonâ€™s pynput library to capture keyboard events.
2. Store captured keystrokes in a local file with proper access permissions.
3. (Optional) Develop techniques to elevate privileges or hide the process to avoid detection.
4. Discuss the legality and ethical implications of keylogging, alongside its applications in security research and testing.

## Key Takeaways

Understanding keyloggers provides insight into preventing keystroke data leaks.
Projects should be conducted under strict ethical guidelines, emphasizing educational alignment.

Note: I Have uploaded a Sample about this. However i have made it a Little bit more Advanced since now, he has Email sending Capabilities and Obfuscastion/Evasion Properties.

# Client-Side Intrusion and Payload Delivery

## Objective/Overview

Experiment with various client-side intrusion techniques focusing on drive-by downloads or malicious file executions for remote access or data exfiltration.
Tools & Techniques
Malicious payloads in document formats (PDF, DOCX)
Exploring social engineering angles for payload delivery
Leveraging Metasploit or custom scripts for payload generation

## Implementation Steps
1. Prepare a payload using specific exploit scenarios targeting common vulnerabilities (e.g., macro exploits in Office documents).
2. Deploy social engineering techniques to seamlessly deliver payloads to target systems.
3. Observe the execution and exfiltration of data within a controlled environment.
4. Summarize steps and emphasize business communication security and training efforts.
   
## Key Takeaways
Demonstrates the real-world impact of client-side breaches and associated risks.
Underlines the importance of awareness training, software patching, and tight access control.
