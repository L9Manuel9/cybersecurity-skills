I Have Experience on Utilizing REMnux and FlareVM, along with minor C2C server and obfuscation techniques.

However, I'd like to share a brief account of my background, particularly when I was 14 and created a Remote Administration Tool (RAT) with a friend of the same age. 
We successfully made it Full Undetected (FUD), which taught me the importance of being vigilant about the ease of infecting a computer with the proper delivery vector.


At that age, I also had experience in conducting anti-cheat screen sharing solutions for Minecraft servers. This involved analyzing key directories, file properties, process injection, and obfuscation techniques, primarily on Windows. If a cheat was injected into a process and ran for a period, even the most advanced techniques would leave traces if Minecraft had to maintain the same session (e.g., not authorized to log out during screen sharing). Our goal was to inspect key points quickly, utilizing automated tools when possible.

EXTRA: Around the same time, as an IT enthusiast, I joined a clan in a videogame where I met individuals with interests in the IT and cyber fields. The clan included people like a 17-year-old who would later become the founder of a notorious stresser, a skilled blackhat professional with expertise in carding and networking, including the darknet. Unfortunately, he was eventually caught and jailed. I also met more ethically oriented individuals, such as the CEO of a well-known Italian hosting service, who is still in business today. There were people like my friend and me, who were experimenting with RATs and ransomware, as well as others who were programming videogame cheats, maintaining websites, or running Telegram channels.

I have fond memories of my time in the clan, as I was friends with everyone. Being skilled in the game, some members took me under their wing, and we would often discuss technical topics while socializing and playing together.




# Reverse Engineering Basics

## Objective/Overview

Software binaries can be disassembled and examined to reveal hidden features, study security measures, or detect weaknesses.

## Tools & Techniques

- IDA Pro, Ghidra, or radare2 for disassembly
- Debugging tools (OllyDbg, Immunity Debugger) for real-time tests; also referred to as dynamic analysis
- Comprehending the principles of assembly language and machine code-{instructions}

## Implementation Steps

1. Load the binary into a disassembler, meaning a code analysis tool to observing initial output, headers, and structure.
2. Determine important strings, functions, and dependencies for target searching or further in-depth analysis.
3. Apply debug tools to monitor how the code runs, modify program flow, or bypass protections.
4. Write down all observations and any vulnerabilities for future validation or exploitation.

## Key Takeaways

- Opens up software for detailed security inspections and hacking prevention.
- The examination shows exactly how software operates internally or where errors exist in software designs.

# Building a Simple Keylogger

## Objective/Overview
Construct a basic keylogger to understand the methods and implications of gathering keystroke data in real-time.

## Tools & Techniques

- Programming using Python together with libraries like pynput
- Basic file I/O operations for local data storage 
- Exploring persistence methods for surviving reboots

## Implementation Steps
1. Add the pynput package to capture keyboard activity.
2. Store captured keystrokes in a local file with proper access permissions.
3. (Optional) Develop techniques to elevate privileges or hide the process to avoid detection.
4. Consider legal aspects plus moral questions of keylogging, alongside its applications in security research and testing.

## Key Takeaways

- Understanding keyloggers provides insight into preventing keystroke data leaks.
- The more i've worked on this project, the more I find things to improve.

Note: I Have uploaded a Sample about this. However i have made it a Little bit more Advanced since now, he has Email sending Capabilities and Obfuscastion/Evasion Properties.

# Client-Side Intrusion and Payload Delivery

## Objective/Overview

Experiment with various client-side intrusion techniques focusing on drive-by downloads or malicious file executions for remote access or data exfiltration.

## Tools & Techniques
- Malicious payloads in document formats (PDF, DOCX)
- Exploring social engineering angles for payload delivery
- Leveraging Metasploit or custom scripts for payload generation

## Implementation Steps
1. Prepare a payload using specific exploit scenarios targeting common vulnerabilities (e.g., macro exploits in Office documents).
2. Deploy social engineering techniques to seamlessly deliver payloads to target systems.
3. Observe the execution and exfiltration of data within a controlled environment.
4. Summarize steps and emphasize business communication security and training efforts.
   
## Key Takeaways
- Demonstrates the real-world impact of client-side breaches and associated risks.
- Underlines the importance of awareness training, software patching, and tight access control.
