This section contains a list about some of the cybersecurity skills I have been learning and practicing, alongside with associated projects.
Due this date, 30/1. I Have completed Over 70 Mini-Projects, To further consolidate my knowledge and Because i've taken it as a Side Challenge who stimulated me during my Journey.
Beginner to Intermediate Level, I have categorized them within those 11 Subfolders.

I did those Mini-Projects alongside with my TryHackMe continous Journey, so I'll citate Some inherent Rooms i Have Completed, Which are completely on my desktop.
Since each room i have been through during my Pathway to increment my knowledge and Achieve every TryHackMe Certificates has been written entirely, in a way to being sure i fully understands the concepts.
We can think of those as Informational Cards who actually try to explain a concept in few words, also for me as a Quick reminder to further consolidate my Knowledge.
