# SSL Stripping with Bettercap

## Objective/Overview
- Exploit encryption downgrades using Bettercap to convert HTTPS traffic to HTTP, exposing it to interception and potential manipulation. Tools & Techniques
- Bettercap for network packet manipulation and modem ARP spoofing
- HTTP vs. HTTPS protocol understanding
- Monitoring and MitM attack techniques
- 
## Implementation Steps
- Set up Bettercap with appropriate network interface settings in a controlled lab environment.
- Enable ARP spoofing to position yourself as a man-in-the-middle between the target and the gateway.
- Activate the sslstrip module, redirecting HTTPS requests to HTTP while logging the traffic.
- Analyze intercepted HTTP traffic for sensitive data like login credentials or session tokens.
- Report findings and recommend implementing HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) and user education on secure browsing practices.
  
## Key Takeaways
- Demonstrates the significant risk posed by improper encryption and HTTP usage.
- Highlights the importance of enforcing HSTS and securing DNS records to prevent similar attacks.
