# Capture The Flags

## Publisher [Difficulty: Easy]

The "Publisher" CTF machine is a simulated environment hosting some services. Through a series of enumeration techniques, including directory fuzzing and version identification, a vulnerability is discovered, allowing for Remote Code Execution (RCE). Attempts to escalate privileges using a custom binary are hindered by restricted access to critical system files and directories, necessitating a deeper exploration into the system's security profile to ultimately exploit a loophole that enables the execution of an unconfined bash shell and achieve privilege escalation.

- I've Choosen this CTF to made a writeup, Because even if it Easy, It Shows the methodology for most Easy boot-to-root machines.
