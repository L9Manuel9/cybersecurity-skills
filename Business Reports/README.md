## About:

The implementation of those discussed several hands-on projects, conducted with well-defined objectives and deadlines, followed
with the support and feedback of an experienced Technical Advisor made available by Academy Rapido. 
To round it out, the discussion with colleagues and the use of key business productivity tools, such as 
Slack, Zoom, Google Drive and Calendar.
I also benefited from a group coaching course led by a ICF-credentialed coach, which enabled me to improve my
ability to work in a team and organize my time in a way that is productive and effective.
Thus further improving my mentality and overall Soft skills.
